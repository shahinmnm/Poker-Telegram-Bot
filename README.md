Welcome to the telegram Bot **"Texas Poker Online"**!!!

**Try it: [@online_poker_bot](https://t.me/online_poker_bot)**

> **Note:** After pulling the latest changes, rerun `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the updated Telegram bot dependencies. The project now requires `python-telegram-bot[job-queue,webhooks]>=20`, so if you install packages manually run `pip install "python-telegram-bot[job-queue,webhooks]>=20"` to get the correct extras.

Texas Poker is one of the most popular game nowsday. And of course there are many applications and webs where you can play. We accidently thought about that why don't we playing poker when we are chatting with friends on the telegram. And how the poker game bot was created.

The bot plays role "our admin": he divides cards, adds cards, controlls whose turn is next, determines the winner and saves our money or can give us bonus money every day.

All things that we need to do is adding bot to your group chat on telegram and every member needs to press the join button at the beginning of round. Then the game will be started. Rules of the texas poker you can read briefly below:

## Architecture overview

The production bot is split into three cooperating layers:

- **Infrastructure glue** ‚Äî [`pokerapp/pokerbot.py`](pokerapp/pokerbot.py) wires the
  Telegram `Application`, injects shared dependencies (logger, Redis, stats,
  metrics), and exposes `run_webhook` / `run_polling` entry points.
- **Game rules** ‚Äî [`pokerapp/game_engine.py`](pokerapp/game_engine.py) implements
  the Texas Hold'em state machine, balancing the pot, advancing stages, and
  finalising results through injected services.
- **User interface** ‚Äî [`pokerapp/pokerbotview.py`](pokerapp/pokerbotview.py)
  renders keyboards, anchors, and throttled Telegram updates through the
  `MessagingService` facade.

The new dependency-injection centric architecture is documented in depth inside
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md), including Mermaid diagrams that
illustrate how `bootstrap.py` wires shared services. For a visual walkthrough of
the per-hand lifecycle consult [`docs/game_flow.md`](docs/game_flow.md), which
contains sequence and swimlane diagrams of the round progression. All diagram
sources live under [`docs/diagrams/`](docs/diagrams) so they can be regenerated
without editing the Markdown guides.

## Game flow reference

For a detailed walkthrough of the startup sequence, per-stage lifecycle, and the
`GameState` transitions (`ROUND_PRE_FLOP` ‚Üí `ROUND_FLOP` ‚Üí `ROUND_TURN` ‚Üí
`ROUND_RIVER` ‚Üí `FINISHED`), consult the [Game Flow guide](docs/game_flow.md).
High-level dependency injection, data flow, and lock hierarchy information lives
in the [Architecture overview](docs/architecture.md). Both documents expand on
the high-level rules below by mapping them back to the actual async functions
that drive table updates, statistics, and message rendering.

**Here is the brief instruction of Texas Poker**\
Every player has two private cards and on the table has five community cards which are dealt face up in the three stages.
On the beginning of game, two people which are selected for big and small blinds. This means the blinds are forced to bet, the small blind bet 5\$ and the big blind bet 10\$.
when cards are divied to every member, the stages will be started.

There are 4 stages in every game:
- The pre-flop: There is no card on the table
- The flop: Add three cards on the table
- The turn: Add to table one card 
- The river: Add to table the last card

In every stage, every member will be betting with actions:
- bet: putting into the pot the chips
- call: putting into the pot the same number of chips
- check: skipping your turn and putting no chips into pot
- raise: putting into the pot more than enough chips to call 
- all-in: putting into the pot all chips that you have
- fold: putting no chips into the pot and is out of the game.
A betting interval ends when the bets have been equalized and the new stage will be started.

The game can end any time if there is only one players in the game and of course when the winner is defined.
After four stages, every member will be show their best hand (five cards from seven cards) to determinate the winner.
The winner is determinated by various combinations of Poker hands rank from five of a kind (the highest) to no pair or nothing (the lowest)

### How to use ?

1. Ensure you have `docker`, `docker-compose`, and `make` installed.
2. Create a token file `make .env POKERBOT_TOKEN="POKERBOT_TOKEN"`.

    > Get token from [@BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather).
3. Start the bot `make up`.

#### Optional environment variables

- `POKERBOT_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`: Overrides the per-chat message rate limit
  enforced by the bot. The default is `20`, matching Telegram's guidance for
  group chats when using webhooks. Lower the value if your deployment is
  frequently rate limited or raise it if you need to burst above the default
  throughput.

### Statistics & database setup

The bot ships with a production-ready statistics engine that keeps track of
advanced player analytics (win/loss counts, streaks, ROI, favourite winning
hands, all-in success rate, pot sizes, bonus usage, and more). Statistics are
only shown in private chat to the requesting player.

1. Provision a PostgreSQL (recommended) or MySQL database and set the
   connection string via `POKERBOT_DATABASE_URL`, e.g.

   ```bash
   export POKERBOT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@db/pokerbot"
   ```

2. Apply the schema found in `migrations/001_create_statistics_tables.sql` to
   the database before launching the bot. The script is idempotent and can be
   executed with any SQL client.

3. (Optional) enable verbose SQL logging during development with
   `POKERBOT_DATABASE_ECHO=1`.

Install the appropriate async driver for your database engine (`asyncpg` for
PostgreSQL, `aiomysql` for MySQL) alongside the base requirements.

When players interact with the bot in private chat they receive a Persian
keyboard containing quick actions:

- `üéÅ ÿ®ŸàŸÜŸàÿ≥ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≤ÿßŸÜŸá` ‚Äî claims the daily bonus in private chat.
- `üìä ÿ¢ŸÖÿßÿ± ÿ®ÿßÿ≤€å` ‚Äî fetches the full statistics report with Persian copy and
  emoji-rich formatting.
- `‚öôÔ∏è ÿ™ŸÜÿ∏€åŸÖÿßÿ™` ‚Äî placeholder for future wallet controls.
- `üÉè ÿ¥ÿ±Ÿàÿπ ÿ®ÿßÿ≤€å` ‚Äî instructs the user how to launch games inside a group.

All statistics updates are recorded automatically at the end of each hand and
are future-proofed for upcoming wallet/deposit/withdrawal features.
